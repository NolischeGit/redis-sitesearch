Logging concepts RSÂ adds to the log different log entries, from various cluster components, for various events and actions that take place in the cluster.

      <description>On the Database &amp;gt; Slow Log page, you can view Slow Log details for Redis Enterprise Software (RS) databases.
Redis Slow Log is one of the best tools for debugging and tracing your Redis database, especially if you experience high latency and high CPU usage with Redis operations. Because Redis is based on a single threaded architecture, Redis Slow Log can be much more useful than slow log mechanisms of multi-threaded database systems such as MySQL Slow Query Log.</description>
