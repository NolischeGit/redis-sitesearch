      <description>The hardware requirements for Redis Enterprise Software (RS) are different for development and production environments.
  In a development environment you can test your application with a live RS database.
If you want to test your application under production conditions, use the production environment requirements.
  In a production environment you must have enough resources to handle the load on the database and recover from failures.
  Development environment You can build your development environment with non-production hardware, such as a laptop, desktop, or small VM or instance, and with these hardware requirements:</description>

      <description>For each node in the cluster, you can configure both persistent storage and ephemeral storage paths.
  Persistent storage is mandatory. It is used by the cluster to store information that needs to persist even if a shard or a node fails, including server logs, configurations, files. For example, if you configure persistence for a database, then the persistence information is stored in this location.
The persistent volume must be a SAN (Storage Area Network) using an EXT4 or XFS file system and be connected as an external storage volume.</description>

      <description>You can configure Redis Enterprise Software (RS) programmatically with client libraries or manually with the RS Web Console.
Redis client libraries For connecting to RS databases with your Redis application, you can use any of the available client libraries listed on Redis.io.
Discovery service We recommend these clients that are tested for use with the Discovery Service that uses the Redis Sentinel API:
 Redis-py (Python redis client) HiRedis (C redis client) Jedis (Java redis client) Ioredis (NodeJS redis client)  If you need to use another client, consider using Sentinel Tunnel to discover the current Redis master with Sentinel and create a TCP tunnel between a local port on the client and the master.</description>

      <title>Synchronizing cluster node clocks</title>

      <description>To avoid problems with internal cluster communications that can impact your data integrity, make sure that the clocks on all of the cluster nodes are synchronized using Chrony and/or NTP.
When you install Redis Enterprise Software, the install script checks if Chrony or NTP is running. If they are not, the installation process asks for permission to configure a scheduled Cron job. This should make sure that the node&amp;rsquo;s clock is always synchronized.</description>
