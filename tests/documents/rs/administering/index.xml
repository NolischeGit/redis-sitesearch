      <description>In Redis Enterprise, active-active geo-distribution is based on CRDT technology. The Redis Enterprise implementation of CRDT is called an Active-Active database (formerly known as CRDB). With Active-Active databases, applications can read and write to the same data set from different geographical locations seamlessly and with latency less than 1 ms, without changing the way the application connects to the database.
Active-Active databases also provide disaster recovery and accelerated data read-access for geographically distributed users.</description>

      <description>In Redis Enterprise, active-passive geo-distribution provides applications read-only access to replicas of the data set from different geographical locations. The Redis Enterprise implementation of active-passive replication is called Replica Of.
In Replica Of, an administrator designates a database as a replica (destination) of one or more databases (sources). After the initial data load from source to destination is completed, all write commands are synchronized from the sources to the destination. Replica Of lets you distribute the read load of your application across multiple databases or synchronize the database, either within Redis Enterprise or external to Redis Enterprise, to another database.</description>

      <description>You can view the Redis Enterprise Software (RS) subscription agreement here. This Product Lifecycle fully reflects our subscription agreement. However, for any discrepancy between the two policies, the subscription agreement prevails.
Redis Enterprise modules follow the modules lifecycle.
Release numbering Redis Labs uses a four-place numbering scheme to designate released versions of its products. The format is “Major1.Major2.Minor-Build”.
 Major sections of the version number represents fundamental changes and additions in capabilities to Redis Enterprise Software.</description>
